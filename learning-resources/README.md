# AI Agent Learning Resources

To deeply understand and build agents, you can use the following learning resources from DeepLearning AI.

"Beginner" and "Intermediate" resources are essential, if you are serious about building production-grade AI Agents.  

"Advanced" resources help you go behind the scenes and gain a lot of depth.
